# Dare to Lead - by Brené Brown

Synopsis by : M. Ridwan Zalbina



# **Synopsis**

The heart of Brown’s book is about courage and vulnerability. You can’t have one without the other, even though many think the two are mutually exclusive. In “Dare to Lead,” Brown sets out to prove why these two traits are so intertwined and how each of us, regardless of age or background, can strengthen these skills to live a more daring, authentic life.

Great leadership requires courage. Many people believe that courage is something you’re born with; either you have it or you don’t. However, Brown disagrees. According to her research, courage is a collection of four key skill sets, which can be taught. These four skills are:

- Rumbling with Vulnerability
- Living into Our Values
- Braving Trust
- Learning to Rise

“Dare to Lead” is organized into four parts, one for each skill. Within each part, Brown outlines the skill in-depth, and provides tools and lessons you need to strengthen it. She also uses the power of storytelling to show what each skill looks like, or the chaos that can result from its absence.

Part one, Rumbling with Vulnerability, is by far the longest of the four. The reason is because vulnerability is the heart of every other skill outlined in the book, and it’s an essential part of living a courageous life. So, Brown spends a great deal of time exploring why courage and vulnerability are so inseparable. She also goes over several myths about vulnerability and the role trust plays, and to love to be vulnarable, and also to be courage : Being clear with people is kind, being unclear is unkind, and lesson learend about courageous we can’t both serve people and try to control their feelings. It's also describing about protecting our ego to fit in, and perfectionism is more about perception than internal motivation, and there is no way to control perception. We need to be joy, because joy is the most vulnerable emotion we feel. The last part is abou shame and empathy, we all have it, shame is universal and one of the primitive human emotions we experience. And there is so much empathy skill that we could learn from this book

Part two, Living Into Our Values, helps you identify what your values are, and how you can use those values to live and work more authentically. We need to have integrity, that choosing courage over comfort. Choosing what's right over what's fun, fast and easy. We need to practicing our values, not just processing them. Daring leaders who live into their values are never silent about hard things. Daring leaders also mastery requires feedback. 

Part three, Braving Trust, outlines how to build trust and — just as importantly — how to build and keep it with your team using seven key behaviors that form the acronym “BRAVING.” Trust between managers and employees, is the primary defining characteristic of very best workplaces. Trust is not one thing that change everything. What we need to know about trust, trus is not to nice have, but it must have, without it every part of our organization can fall into despair. The seven key behaviours is a rumble tool : 

- B = *Boundaries* – Respect others’ boundaries and willingness to ask
- R = *Reliability* – You do what you say you’ll do
- A = *Accountability* – You own your mistake, apologize, and make amends
- V = *Vault* – Don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share
- I = *Integrity* – Choose courage over comfort
- N = *Non-Judgement* – We can talk about how we feel and ask for help without judgement
- G = *Generosity* – Extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others 

Leaders say that asking for help help you to build trust. Asking for help is a power move and a sign of strength to fight off judgement when others raise their hands. It reflects a self-awareness that is an *essential element* in braving trust.

Part four, Learning to Rise, covers failure — and how important failure is to taking risks and leading courageously. In this last section, Brown goes over a three-step process to fail more effectively and get back up again. **Ham Foldover Debacle**: You make yourself the center of something that has nothing to do with you out of your own fear or scarcity only to be reminded that you’re not the axis on which the world turns. Ther are  three-step process to learning to rise:

- The reckoning
- The rumble
- The revolution

Emotions are called feelings because we physically feel them in our bodies. This is how our bodies are connected to our mind. Risers are more emotionally connected to their bodies and pay attention to them. Pain is hard, it's easier to pissed off or angry than to acknowledge hurt. In this case, our ego does the dirty work. It denies emotion and hates curiosity. We don’t trust people who don’t struggle, who don’t have bad days or hard times, we don’t find connection with people we don’t find relatable. *Practicing calm* is one of the most underrated leadership superpowers, **calm** is creating perspective and mindfulness while managing emotional reactivity. Confabulation is a lie told honestly, it's to replace missing information with something false that we believe to be true. It’s so much more honest, vulnerable, and disarming to state your proclamation is just conjecture that you want to get clarity on. And you will know that the courage is rebellion, that means you choosing authenticity and worthiness is an act of resistance in today’s world, choosing to live and love with our whole hearts is an act of defiance. 

Three main things she’s learned from all her research:

1. The *level of collective courage* in an organization is the absolute best predictor of the organizations ability to be successful in terms of its culture, to develop leaders, and to meet its mission
2. The greatest challenge in developing brave leaders is helping them acknowledge and answer their personal call to courage
   - Courage can be learned if we are willing to *put down the armor* and pick up shared language, tools and skills that we need for rumbling with vulnerability, living into our values, braving trust, and learning to rise
3. We fail the minute we *let someone else define success* for us
