You may think in order to lead you need to look like a strong kind a person who doesn't admit failure. That it is necessary to avoid truth that can hurt someone sentimentally. These things often happen because that is how leadership viewed by society.

But the truth is that the opposite behaviour is that would produce the best result. The author in "Dare to Lead" show us how to take a charge and lead, eliminating once and for all our misconceptions.

**For whom is this book is dedicated**

If you want to learn how to be a better leader, you need to forgot about all the status, power etc. Instead, be prepared to engage your heart and mind by finding out how the most courageous leaders think, feel and behave.



**Main idea of this book**

- Courage and vulnerability always go hand in hand
- Limiting your values to just two, you can be a successfull person even in the most difficult times
- Vulnerability leads to innovation and why bravery and perfectionism don't mix



**#1 Far from being weakness, vulnerability is an essential asset for innovation**

What makes you feel vulnerable ? The author always question to thousands of individuals over 6 years of research.

After all, for her to be clear is to be gentle, like using a communication that is not clear is the same as being cruel.  In that way, if you do not use clarity when you set your expectations about what you want from your contributors, you will blame them for not giving more.

According to Brown, the time that you spend for doing this, will be less than the time you spent for trying to match the unproductive and ineffective behaviour of your subordinates or employees

It is important to always ask for clear feedback from team members by listening to them truly.



**#3 Core values anchor and guide daring leadership**

Our values inform our judgements about what is most important in our lives. The most courageous leaders that the author came across during her research were those who had the most clarity about what their values were. During times of uncertainty and vulnerability, their values were an important support to the. They were more willing to take risks, secure in the knowledge that their values would guide them through without compromising their integrity.
